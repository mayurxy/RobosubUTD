motor control tips:

tested on 12V

0 to 125 speed decreases in one direction
130 to 255 speed increases another direction
125 to 130 deadband

motor fwd
0 - 100  map to--> 125 - 0

motor rev
0 - 100  map to--> 130 - 255

motor break
128      or       dir = LOW

arduino gets latched if there are sudden state change and for example when motor at high speed changes direction changes direction.

solution: break the motor and introduce small delay just to recover driver(tested)
